# NEWCO
## Liquid Emerging VC Manager Fund-of-Funds

---

### The Opportunity

**Emerging managers (< $250M AUM) outperform established funds by 300-500 basis points,** but remain largely inaccessible to institutional LPs due to:
- High operational burden (diligence, portfolio construction, ongoing monitoring)
- Capital constraints (typical $5-10M minimums × 15-20 managers = $75-200M commitment)
- Liquidity lockup (10+ year horizons)

**NEWCO solves this.**

---

### What We Do

- **Access:** Curated portfolio of 15-20 exceptional emerging managers
- **Liquidity:** Quarterly redemptions vs. 10+ year lockups
- **Efficiency:** 1.25% management fee (no carry) vs. traditional 2/20
- **Diversification:** Across sectors, stages, vintages, and geographies
