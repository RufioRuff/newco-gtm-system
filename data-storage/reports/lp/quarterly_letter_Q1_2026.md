## Market Commentary

The venture capital market in Q1 2026 continued to show signs of stabilization following the correction of 2022-2023. While fundraising remains challenging for many managers, we believe this environment creates opportunities for disciplined investors to access high-quality funds at more attractive terms.

Key market themes:

- **Valuation Discipline:** Fund managers are applying more rigorous valuation standards
- **Extended Hold Periods:** Exit timelines have lengthened, requiring patient capital
- **AI Investment:** Significant capital flowing to AI/ML infrastructure and applications
- **Sector Rotation:** Continued strength in enterprise software, healthcare IT, and climate tech

We remain focused on our core strategy of investing in emerging managers with differentiated approaches and strong track records.
