Hi {{name}},

{{hook}}

I'm reaching out regarding NEWCO, a liquid emerging VC manager fund-of-funds that may align with {{company}}'s alternative investment strategy.

**Key differentiators:**
- Access to 15-20 emerging managers (sub-$250M funds) with exceptional track records
- Quarterly liquidity vs. 10+ year lockups
- Transparent 1.25% fee structure (vs. traditional 2/20)
- Diversified exposure across sectors and stages

We're targeting $50M for Fund I and are in active conversations with several institutional LPs. Given {{company}}'s focus on {{investment_focus}}, this could provide efficient VC exposure with meaningful cost savings.

Would you be open to a 30-minute call to discuss portfolio fit? I can share our manager pipeline and return projections.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
NEWCO
