Hi {{name}},

{{hook}}

I'm launching NEWCO, an emerging VC manager fund-of-funds focused on early-stage venture. We're building a portfolio of 15-20 high-conviction emerging managers with a transparent 1.25% management fee structure (no carry).

Given {{company}}'s expertise in manager selection, I'd value 20 minutes of your time to discuss:
- Emerging manager opportunity set in 2026
- Platform trends and institutional appetite
- Fee transparency vs. traditional 2/20 structures

Would you be open to a brief exploratory conversation? I'm flexible on timing and happy to work around your schedule.
