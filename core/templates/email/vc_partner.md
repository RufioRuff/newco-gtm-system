Hi {{name}},

{{hook}}

I'm launching NEWCO, an emerging VC manager fund-of-funds, and am building relationships with top-tier VC firms for two reasons:

1. **LP Introductions**: I'm seeking intros to 2-3 LPs from {{firm_name}}'s LP base who might be interested in a liquid VC access vehicle
2. **Co-investment**: We're building an Omniscient-powered deal flow platform and would love to explore co-investment opportunities

**NEWCO in brief:**
- Investing in 15-20 emerging managers (sub-$250M funds)
- 1.25% fee structure with quarterly liquidity
- Targeting $50M Fund I
- Strong Berkeley ecosystem ties

Would you be open to a quick call to discuss? I'm particularly interested in {{specific_interest}}.

{{mutual_connection_mention}}

Thanks for considering!

Best,
[Your Name]
