Hi {{name}},

{{hook}}

I'm reaching out regarding NEWCO, an emerging VC manager fund-of-funds that aligns with {{foundation_name}}'s mission around {{mission_area}}.

**Mission alignment:**
- Focus on diverse, emerging managers (many first-time funds, underrepresented backgrounds)
- Strong Berkeley ecosystem ties (innovation, research translation)
- Transparent fee structure (1.25% vs. 2/20) = more capital to mission
- Access to high-growth impact sectors: {{relevant_sectors}}

**Investment structure:**
- 15-20 emerging managers (sub-$250M funds)
- Quarterly liquidity for portfolio management flexibility
- Institutional-grade due diligence and reporting

Given {{foundation_name}}'s focus on {{investment_strategy}}, this could provide efficient VC exposure while advancing mission objectives around manager diversity and innovation access.

Would you be open to a conversation to explore fit? I'd value your perspective and can share our manager pipeline.

{{mutual_connection_mention}}

Best regards,
[Your Name]
NEWCO
